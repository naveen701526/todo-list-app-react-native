# Todo List App Built using React Native

#### This is a simple todo list app to jot down the task one perform in his/her daily life. When Done with the task just delete it in the app.

#### UUID is used to generate unique keys in order to store it in local storage (AsyncStorage module was used to realize this feature). Modern React Native Features like hooks, useState, useEffect, props, functional components were used.

### Here is a video to demonstrate the working of this small mini project.
